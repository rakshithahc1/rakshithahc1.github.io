The_New_Use_Experience: 
  I was trying to reason it out in my mind, I knew that the weapon cannot
  function without someone triggering it. Only people who could trigger this was
  by the messages that were coming in from a designated source system. No one
  outside of this source had the ability to trigger this.

  I was trying to reason it out in my mind, I knew that the weapon cannot
  function without someone triggering it. Only people who could trigger this was
  by the messages that were coming in from a designated source system. No one
  outside of this source had the ability to trigger this. My analysis turned out
  to be true, I could see that there were half a million army of messages
  marching in and each one of them were aiming and shooting down at the target
  database. These army were wearing the uniforms and they were pouring in like
  the storm troopers of the source application. But how could it be, I knew
  there was neither breach in our system... nor in the source system and the
  numbers were too huge to be true... looking at those numbers I was excited to
  see that the weapon I wrote was able to function the way we wanted even in
  this huge influx of messages...  but the sad part was it was jeopardizing the
  database's life and destroying my own home. This was when I had to call our
  super hero.
